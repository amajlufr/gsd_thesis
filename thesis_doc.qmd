# 1. INTRODUCTION

Accessibility —the ease of reaching destinations— has been a foundational concept in urban planning since the mid-20th century. It captures the interplay between transportation networks and the spatial distribution of urban opportunities, considering the time, cost, and effort associated with travel. In rapidly evolving and spatially fragmented urban contexts, accessibility plays a central role in shaping patterns of spatial inequality and urban form. Among the most tangible reflections of this influence are housing prices, which not only reflect the market value of physical structures, but also the locational advantages embedded in their surroundings.

Hedonic pricing models (HPMs), grounded in Rosen’s (1974) framework, estimate how various property attributes—such as location, size, and amenities—are capitalized into housing prices. Given the heterogeneous nature of real estate, HPMs are particularly useful for disentangling the contribution of individual features to price variation. Accessibility remains a key, yet inconsistently measured, component in these models. Most commonly, it is represented by simplified proximity metrics—often focused solely on employment—while broader access to urban amenities remains underexplored. Moreover, the use of aggregated spatial units introduces the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), where arbitrary boundary definitions can distort statistical relationships and mask localized variation (add citation about MAUP).

In response to these gaps, the present study develops a granular and multimodal analysis of how sector-specific accessibility influences housing prices in Mexico City. Drawing on an original dataset of web-scraped, georeferenced real estate listings and accessibility indices calculated at the listing level, the research evaluates the relationship between property values and access to a diverse array of destinations, including employment, education, health, retail, gastronomy, recreation, and public space. While earlier studies—such as Atuesta et al. (2018)—have shown that job accessibility is capitalized into real estate prices in Mexico City, prior analyses have often remained limited to employment-focused or aggregated accessibility measures.

This study contributes to three areas of inquiry. First, it broadens the understanding of how different types of amenities beyond employment are valued in the housing market, questioning whether accessibility is universally perceived as an amenity or whether certain forms of proximity function as disamenities. Second, it refines the methodological approach by addressing MAUP through the use of fine-grained origin data and sector-specific destinations. Third, it adds empirical evidence from a Global South metropolis —where land value dynamics may diverge from conventional assumptions— thereby contributing to a more geographically diverse urban economic literature.

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 reviews the relevant literature on accessibility, its measurement, and its integration into hedonic pricing models. Chapter 3 outlines the methodological framework, detailing the data sources, construction of the accessibility index, and the econometric specification, including all explanatory variables. Chapter 4 presents the empirical results, covering: (i) the descriptive and spatial analysis of accessibility patterns at the block level across Mexico City, (ii) an overview of the real estate market and its spatial relationship to accessibility, and (iii) the results of the hedonic pricing models. Chapter 5 provides a discussion of the findings, focusing on the differentiated impacts of accessibility across sectors and transport modes. Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of key findings, theoretical and policy implications, and recommendations for future research.

# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

## ACCESSIBILITY AS A CONCEPT

Accessibility has been a core topic in urban planning literature since the mid-20th century (Hansen, 1959) (CTV note: the citation is evidence that a paper existing on this topic as early as 1959, but not that it has beeb a core topic in the discipline). Commonly defined as the ease of reaching desired destinations, accessibility reflects both the mobility afforded by transportation networks and the spatial distribution of opportunities—such as jobs, services, or amenities—along with the time, cost, and effort associated with travel (Boisjoly & El-Geneidy, 2017; Levinson & Wu, 2020).

Its significance lies in its influence on the economic value of urban land, shaping the intensity and type of development that occurs across different locations (CTV note: a citation here would be good, especially since this is the literature review). Accessibility disparities are deeply intertwined with broader patterns of spatial and social inequality, as variations in access—often shaped by demographic and socioeconomic factors—directly impact quality of life and underscore the need for more equitable urban policy frameworks (Wachs & Kumagai, 1973).

The concept has demonstrated relevance across a wide range of urban processes, including commuting behaviors (citation), employment access (citation), service provision (citation), real estate valuation and development (citation), environmental sustainability (citation), and social inclusion (citation). Its centrality in shaping urban form and function continues to make accessibility a foundational lens through which urban dynamics are studied and interpreted (El-Geneidy & Levinson, 2022; Levinson & Wu, 2020; Cervero, Rood, & Appleyard, 1999; Atuesta et al., 2018).

## ACCESSIBILITY MEASUREMENTS

Accessibility measures vary widely in their conceptual foundations and methodological approaches. As outlined by Siddiq and Taylor (2021), one of the most straightforward approaches is the cumulative opportunities measure, which quantifies the number of destinations—typically jobs or services—reachable within a defined time or distance threshold. While valued for their simplicity and ease of communication, these measures assume all destinations offer equal utility, failing to account for variations in quality or desirability. To address this limitation, gravity-based measures incorporate a distance decay function that gives greater weight to closer destinations, reflecting the reduced likelihood of traveling to more distant locations (citation - I suggest Handy and Niemeier 1997). These models integrate the generalized cost of travel—such as time, distance, and monetary expense—offering a more nuanced representation of accessibility. Utility-based measures take this further by shifting the analytical focus from destinations to individuals or households (you could cite Hand and Neimeier here too). They can incorporate factors such as user preferences, socioeconomic attributes, and perceptions of destination attractiveness, aiming to estimate the expected maximum utility derived from a set of travel alternatives. This allows for a more personalized and behaviorally grounded understanding of accessibility. Finally, constraints-based or space–time measures introduce a temporal dimension by acknowledging the scheduling and sequencing of daily activities (citation). These approaches recognize that accessibility is not only spatial but also shaped by individuals’ available time windows and activity patterns.

In summary, accessibility measures span a spectrum from simple to theoretically robust. Cumulative opportunity measures are easier to compute and communicate but lack nuance, while more complex models capture behavioral and temporal dimensions at the cost of increased data and analytical demands (Siddiq & Taylor, 2021). Despite the growing sophistication of accessibility research, its practical application in planning remains limited, often due to gaps between theoretical frameworks and real-world constraints (Boisjoly & El-Geneidy, 2017).

In addition to the conceptual variations in accessibility modeling, differences in how impedance is specified can significantly affect measurement outcomes, especially within the context of hedonic price models. Impedance refers to the resistance or effort required to reach a destination and is commonly categorized into five types: Euclidean distance, network distance, travel time, cost, and zone-based measures (Heyman et al., 2018). Euclidean distance represents straight-line proximity and offers a basic, objective baseline. Network distance adds realism by accounting for the actual traversable paths through a transport network. Travel time introduces temporal dynamics, considering congestion or average speed variations, while cost-based impedance captures monetary expenses associated with travel. Zone-based measures rely on spatial aggregations, such as administrative boundaries, and are often used when data is limited. However, these zonal aggregations are especially vulnerable to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)—a spatial bias that can distort results depending on the size and configuration of the spatial units used. MAUP comprises two components: the scale effect, where statistical outcomes shift depending on the number or size of areal units, and the zoning effect, where boundary definitions alone can lead to different conclusions. These issues underscore the importance of using disaggregated data or carefully chosen spatial units to preserve local variation and ensure alignment with perceived accessibility (Heyman et al., 2018).

Striking a balance between simplicity and complexity is crucial. Introducing stakeholders to basic cumulative measures may serve as a useful entry point, while simultaneously advocating for the added insights of distance-sensitive or utility-based models. As El-Geneidy and Levinson (2022) argue, the challenge lies in translating theoretical advancements into tools that are both actionable and accessible for planning practice.

## ACCESSIBILITY IN THE HEDONIC PRICE MODEL FRAMEWORK

Hedonic pricing models (HPMs) provide a foundational framework for estimating the implicit value of individual product characteristics by analyzing observed prices and the attributes of differentiated goods. Rooted in Rosen’s (1974) seminal work, this approach views goods as bundles of characteristics, aligning with theories of spatial equilibrium and equalizing differences. In the real estate context, this framework is especially relevant, as housing markets are inherently heterogeneous—each property is unique in its physical features, location, and historical usage, making precise valuation inherently complex.

Unlike goods traded in efficient markets, real estate lacks product homogeneity, frequent transactions, and transparent pricing. Properties are not priced by individual attributes but as composite packages, creating what Rosen (1974) describes as implicit markets. Buyers and sellers negotiate based on subjective valuations of inseparable traits—such as location, size, amenities, and architectural style—rather than standardized units, which complicates pricing and contributes to overall market inefficiency (Evans, 1995).

Despite these challenges, hedonic pricing models remain the dominant method for estimating residential property values, breaking down a home’s sale price into the marginal contributions of its attributes. Since the mid-2000s, the literature on HPMs has expanded significantly, addressing key market disruptions (e.g., the Great Recession), integrating new thematic concerns such as climate vulnerability, financing structures, and neighborhood dynamics, and employing increasingly advanced methodologies. Recent approaches include instrumental variable techniques (e.g., 2SLS), hazard models, quantile regression, and machine learning tools such as random forests—reflecting the complexity and richness of contemporary housing data (Khoshnoud et al., 2023).

Accessibility is a critical yet variably treated component in HPMs. Its influence on housing prices is well-documented, but its measurement varies significantly across studies, affecting both theoretical soundness and empirical reliability. As Heyman et al. (2018) note, accessibility can be conceptualized using several frameworks—including spatial separation, cumulative opportunity, gravitational potential, utility-based access, and time-space constraints—each offering a distinct lens. The choice of measure can significantly shape outcomes, particularly given that buyers perceive and value accessibility differently depending on local context and individual preferences.

Different modeling approaches have also emerged for constructing housing price indices, each with strengths and limitations. Repeat-sales indices track changes in property values by comparing repeat transactions of the same property. While effective in controlling for unobservable characteristics, these models face sample selection biases and assume stability in property attributes over time. In contrast, hedonic-regression-based indices allow for greater control over attribute-specific changes but are sensitive to omitted variables and model specification choices. As Wallace and Meese (1997) emphasize, hedonic indices may be more reliable for assessing local market behavior, while simpler metrics such as median sales prices remain useful for tracking broader housing market cycles.

The era of big data is transforming real estate valuation, introducing new data sources—from online listings and remote sensing to IoT devices—and enabling models that can integrate real-time, multidimensional inputs. Machine learning models, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, deep learning, and gradient-boosting algorithms such as XGBoost, offer strong predictive performance and adaptability to complex data structures. However, these models introduce new challenges around interpretability, particularly in policy contexts where transparency and accountability are critical (Wei et al., 2022). In modeling housing prices, accessibility specifications have traditionally relied on proximity to central business districts (CBDs), major roads, or public transit stations. However, recent machine learning models have revealed that street network connectivity, or local street closeness, may be a more stable and informative predictor of home values than simple CBD proximity (Liu et al., 2024). This insight challenges conventional assumptions in urban economic models and highlights the evolving role of urban form in shaping property values.

Ultimately, the field continues to evolve toward more nuanced, behaviorally grounded, and technologically enabled valuation methods. Yet, the integration of accessibility remains a central concern, as its conceptualization and measurement directly influence valuation accuracy. Bridging this gap—between methodological sophistication and practical applicability—remains a key task for both researchers and practitioners seeking to better understand and shape urban real estate dynamics.

### CURRENT EVIDENCE ON MEXICO CITY

In the specific case of Mexico City, only one study performed by Atuesta et al. (2018) was found that evaluates the effects of accessibility on predicted housing prices. Here, the authors use geographically referenced data on new housing developments to estimate how households value accessibility to employment and transport infrastructure.

Their results indicate that proximity to employment subcenters increases housing values by 1–3%, suggesting that access to formal job markets is capitalized into real estate prices. In contrast, proximity to the Central Business District (CBD) is considered a disamenity, reflecting the declining relevance of the historic core and the ongoing decentralization of employment in the city. The effects of proximity to Metro stations are non-linear: while homes located directly adjacent to stations may be discounted due to congestion, informal commerce, and insecurity, a moderate distance from Metro infrastructure is associated with higher property values.

These patterns are shaped by sharp socioeconomic divides. High-income households, who are more likely to own private vehicles, benefit more from accessibility and enjoy shorter commutes, while low-income households tend to live farther from job centers, often relying on informal employment and transport modes. This spatial mismatch reinforces patterns of segregation and limits access to economic opportunity.

The authors argue that these challenges cannot be addressed through infrastructure investment alone. Instead, they emphasize the importance of integrated land-use and transport planning—such as transit-oriented development and the revitalization of urban cores—to make public transit systems more attractive and equitable across income groups.

# 3. METHODOLOGY

This study adopts a theoretical framework that explores the relationship between real estate prices and three key dimensions: accessibility, dwelling quality, and neighborhood characteristics. The following sections detail the procedures for data collection and processing related to each of these components.

## REAL ESTATE LISTINGS

To compile a structured dataset of current real estate listings in Mexico City, a custom R script was developed to extract information from paginated JSON endpoints provided by a major online real estate broker. For each listing, the script captured a range of attributes, including listing identifiers and timestamps; property characteristics such as type, total and built surface area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the presence of amenities like parking; as well as pricing information, including listed price and currency. Geographic details were also collected, covering street address, neighborhood, and geolocation coordinates.

The data collection script was executed 16 times over a three-month period, from January to April 2025, with runs spaced at regular intervals to capture temporal variation in the real estate market. This repeated extraction enabled the construction of a longitudinal dataset, after which a cleaning and filtering procedure was applied. Duplicate entries were removed by retaining only the most recent record for each property, based on the retrieval date. The dataset was then filtered to include only properties listed for sale within the administrative boundaries of Mexico City and restricted to residential property types. Listing prices were standardized by converting all values to U.S. dollars using a fixed exchange rate of 20 MXN per USD for entries originally priced in Mexican pesos. The final dataset contains 1,560 observations.

## ACCESSIBILITY INDEX

While real estate listings served as the origin points in the accessibility analysis, destinations were drawn from the most recent National Directory of Economic Units (DENUE, 2024). This dataset provides granular, georreferenced information on individual economic establishments, including their 6-digit NAICS classification and corresponding employment size bands. These employment bands were converted into approximate numeric estimates using the midpoint of each range, with a tailored adjustment for the highest category to better reflect potential outliers. Establishments located within both Mexico City and adjacent municipalities in neighboring states were included to ensure spatial continuity, particularly for listings situated near the administrative boundaries of the city. In parallel, public space data was sourced from Mexico City open data portal.

To support the routing engine required for travel time estimation, road network data were sourced from OpenStreetMap for both Mexico City and the State of Mexico. While state geometries were merged within R, the final consolidated routable network in Protocolbuffer Binary Format (PBF) was constructed externally using Osmosis, due to R’s limitations in handling PBF file merging. This composite road network served as the base layer for accessibility analysis. Additionally, the most recent General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS, 2024) data for Mexico City were obtained from its open data portal.

Multimodal travel time matrices were computed using the r5r routing engine. For each origin–destination pair, travel times were estimated under two transportation scenarios: private motor vehicle and public transit (combined with walking). The routing represented conditions on a typical weekday at 8:00 a.m. It is important to consider that r5r computed private travel times do not account for traffic.

Accessibility was then assessed for seven types of opportunities relevant to residents: the number of jobs, and the number of economic units in sectors such as retail, education, health, recreation, and gastronomy—based on 2-digit NAICS codes (and 3-digit for gastronomy, only)—as well as public spaces as defined by the CDMX government. For each category, two accessibility measures were calculated: a cumulative opportunity measure, which counts the number of destinations reachable within 10, 20, and 30 minutes, and a gravity-based measure, which weights opportunities by their proximity using an exponential decay function with multiple parameters (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2). Accessibility was calculated under both public transit and private vehicle scenarios, resulting in a total of 28 indicators for each transport mode, destination type, and analytical method.

## NEIGHBOURHOOD CHARACTERISTICS

To contextualize real estate listings within neighborhood conditions, both crime data and block-level social development indicators were incorporated. The crime dataset included georeferenced events from 2023 onward, published on the Mexico City open data portal, focusing only on incidents with physical harm. Each listing was spatially joined to nearby crime occurrences within a 500-meter buffer to estimate localized exposure to violent events. In addition, listings were linked to the corresponding block-level Social Development Index, a composite metric ranging from 0 to 1. This index represents an average of multiple dimensions of deprivation, including housing quality, sanitation, energy access, telecommunications, essential goods availability, education, social security, and health services. To further account for contextual variation, the corresponding municipality of each listing was registered as well to include heterogeneity across administrative boundaries.

## REGRESSION SPECIFICATION

The hedonic price model was specified as a log-log regression, estimated separately for both private and public accessibility, according to the following structure:

$$
log(Price_i) = \alpha + \beta log(Accessibility_{i}) + \gamma Dwelling_{i} + \delta Neighbourhood_{i} + \mu_i
$$

where:

-   $i$ represents individual real estate listings;
-   $Price_i$ denotes the listing price in USD for property $i$;
-   $Accessibility_{i}$ is a vector of accessibility variables for listing $i$ corresponding to different destination types (jobs, retail, education, health, recreation, gastronomy, and public spaces);
-   $Dwelling_{i}$ is a vector of dwelling characteristics for listing $i$, including constructed area (in squared meters), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and parking spaces;
-   $Neighbourhood_{i}$ is a vector of neighbourhood-level characteristics of listing $i$, including the number of reported crimes within a 500m radius, the Social Development Index of the corresponding census block, and a categorical fixed effect for the listing’s municipality, capturing administrative-level variation.
-   $\mu_{i}$ is the error term.

To evaluate model validity and ensure robust inference, standard regression diagnostics were conducted. The Breusch-Pagan test indicated the presence of heteroskedasticity, while the Durbin-Watson test suggested slight positive autocorrelation in the residuals. Furthermore, multicollinearity was identified among some accessibility indicators according to the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) diagnostics—an expected outcome given the conceptual overlap between destination types. However, rather than removing these variables or applying dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), all indicators were retained, as they represent the core constructs under study.

While these violations do not bias the estimated coefficients themselves under OLS assumptions, they can affect the reliability of standard errors and inference. To address these issues while preserving the integrity of the specification, robust standard errors (via the Huber-White estimator) and municipality-clustered standard errors were employed. This approach corrects for heteroskedasticity and allows for arbitrary correlation of errors within municipalities, thereby addressing both multicollinearity-related inference issues and potential spatial autocorrelation within administrative boundaries. Residual normality was also assessed for both models using the Shapiro-Wilk test, which indicated deviations from normality. Given the moderate sample size and the use of robust and clustered standard errors, inference can be considered reliable despite this violation.

# 4. RESULTS

This section presents the main empirical findings of the study. It is organized into three parts. First, we analyze the construction and behavior of the accessibility index, examining its methodological structure, sector-specific patterns, and spatial distribution. Second, we explore the dynamics of the real estate market, including overall price distributions and their relationship to accessibility levels. Finally, we present the results of hedonic price models that quantify the influence of accessibility and other factors on real estate values.

## ACCESSIBILITY INDEX

This subsection presents a comprehensive accessibility analysis for Mexico City (CDMX), using urban blocks—the most detailed spatial resolution available from national census data—as the unit of origin. This approach captures how accessibility to jobs and essential services varies across the city, extending beyond the scope of real estate listings to include the broader urban structure.

### METHODS AND INTERVAL ANALYSIS

Figures 1 and 2 compare the distribution of job accessibility indices across Mexico City in 2024, using two measurement methodologies—cumulative and gravity-based—for both public and private modes of transportation.

Figure 1 illustrates public job accessibility, accounting for walking and public transport as the primary modes of travel. The distribution of accessibility values is heavily right-skewed under both methodologies, with most spatial units exhibiting relatively low access to public sector employment under high impedance scenarios. As impedance decreases—either by extending time thresholds or reducing the decay parameter—the accessibility index increases, resulting in a broader and more dispersed distribution.

![Public Job Accessibility by Measurement Methodology](output_vis/acc_methods_public_hist.png)

In contrast, Figure 2 presents private job accessibility, estimated using car-based travel. Across all impedance levels, distributions show substantially higher accessibility values, reflecting the broader spatial distribution of private employment and the relative advantage of car access in reaching jobs. In the cumulative panel, accessibility increases markedly as travel time thresholds expand, shifting the frequency distribution rightward from high to low impedance. This shift suggests that, under 20- or 30-minute thresholds, most job destinations become accessible when traffic is not considered—potentially diminishing the interpretive value of cumulative measures under such assumptions. The gravity-based panel exhibits decreasing concentration with increasing impedance, consistent with the logic of exponential decay applied in its computation.

![Private Job Accessibility by Measurement Methodology](output_vis/acc_methods_private_hist.png)

Comparing the two figures highlights clear disparities between transportation modes. Private job accessibility not only yields higher values but also displays greater variance than public job accessibility. This suggests that individuals dependent on walking and public transport face more constrained access to employment opportunities. Furthermore, the interpretive validity of cumulative private accessibility under low impedance may be limited in contexts where congestion and traffic dynamics are excluded from travel time estimates.

Figures 3 and 4 explore the degree of concordance between cumulative and gravity-based accessibility measures across various sectors in Mexico City during 2024. Based on the interpretations of Figures 1 and 2, the remaining of the present study focuses on low-impedance public accessibility and high-impedance private accessibility. Across both figures, a strong linear relationship is evident between the two measurement methodologies.

In the public accessibility context (Figure 3), all sectors exhibit near-perfect correlations (R ≥ 0.99), with employment, education, recreation, and gastronomy showing virtual correlations of R = 1. This indicates that under low-impedance public transport conditions, cumulative and gravity-based measures yield highly consistent results, suggesting methodological interchangeability when evaluating access to these types of destinations.

![Public Accessibility by Sector and Measurement Technology](output_vis/acc_methods_public_aggr_corr.png)

In the private accessibility context (Figure 4), correlations remain high but are slightly lower than in the public case, ranging from R = 0.96 (health, public spaces) to R = 0.98 (employment, education, gastronomy). Although the distributions still align closely with the 1:1 line, greater dispersion is observed relative to the public accessibility plots. This suggests a somewhat higher sensitivity to methodological differences under high-impedance conditions; nonetheless, the results remain strongly aligned.

![Private Accessibility by Sector and Measurement Technology](output_vis/acc_methods_private_aggr_corr.png)

Overall, the comparison highlights a notable degree of alignment between cumulative and gravity-based methodologies across both sectors and travel modes. While gravity-based methods are often favored for their ability to model distance decay effects, cumulative measures may be preferred for their simplicity and interpretability. In this context, either method appears to serve as a valid proxy for the other under appropriate impedance assumptions. These findings reinforce the internal consistency of the accessibility modeling framework and provide methodological flexibility for practitioners choosing between ease of implementation and behavioral precision in accessibility assessments. For simplicity and easer interpretation, the remaining of this study will consider cumulative metrics.

### SECTORIAL ANALYSIS

Figures 5 through 8 display the distribution of sectoral accessibility values in Mexico City during 2024 using violin plots, distinguishing between public and private accessibility and further separating employment-based (Figures 5 and 6) and economic unit-based (Figures 7 and 8) indicators. These plots provide a more granular view of accessibility by economic sector, while also revealing the skewness and concentration of opportunities across Mexico City.

Figure 5 presents public accessibility to employment. The distributions are notably right-skewed, particularly for *Professional & Administrative* and *Industrial & Logistics* sectors, where a large number of spatial units cluster at low accessibility levels. *Retail & Services* shows a relatively flatter and broader distribution, indicating more spatial dispersion in access to these jobs.

![Public Employment Accessibility Density by Sector](output_vis/acc_sectorial_public_employment_violin.png)

In contrast, Figure 6 shows private accessibility to employment. All three employment categories display significantly higher accessibility values compared to their public counterparts, with distributions stretching further to the right. Nevertheless, strong concentration remains at lower access values, especially in Professional & Administrative and Industrial & Logistics sectors, highlighting persistent spatial disparities even in a car-oriented access model.

![Private Employment Accessibility Density by Sector](output_vis/acc_sectorial_private_employment_violin.png)

Figure 7, representing public accessibility, again exhibits strong right-skewed distributions across all sectors. The most constrained access is seen in Recreation, Public Spaces, and Education, where a large share of the population has access to a limited number of facilities.

![Public Economic Accessibility Density by Sector](output_vis/acc_sectorial_public_units_violin.png)

In Figure 8, private accessibility shows broader distributions and higher accessibility values across all sectors. The accessibility to Retail and Gastronomy units is particularly elevated, likely due to their dense and dispersed urban presence. However, Recreation and Public Spaces remain skewed toward lower values, suggesting that even with private mobility, access to urban amenities of collective use remains relatively geographically limited.

![Private Economic Accessibility Density by Sector](output_vis/acc_sectorial_private_units_violin.png)

### SPATIAL ANALYSIS

Figures 9 and 10 present the spatial distribution of average accessibility z-scores for public and private modes, respectively, aggregated across all analyzed sectors. The values represent standardized accessibility per urban block, with blue areas denoting above-average access and red areas reflecting below-average access.

In Figure 9, public accessibility reveals a pronounced core-periphery pattern, aligned with public transit infrastructure and routes. Central blocks exhibit consistently high accessibility across sectors, forming a dense cluster of blue and purple zones. In contrast, peripheral zones are marked by deep red, indicating significant deviations below the citywide mean. This highlights stark geographical disparities in access to basic services and economic opportunities for transit-dependent populations.

![Average Public Accessibility per Urban Block](output_vis/acc_public_avg_z_map.png)

Figure 10, which maps private accessibility displays a similar spatial trend, but with noticeably more diffuse gradients. While central zones still dominate in terms of accessibility, a broader spread of light-blue and neutral zones suggests that private vehicles slightly attenuate the intensity of spatial inequality, allowing some peripheral areas to reach modest accessibility levels. However, deep-red zones remain widespread in the urban periphery, especially to the south.

![Average Private Accessibility per Urban Block](output_vis/acc_private_avg_z_map.png)

Figures 11 and 12 disaggregate these results by **sector**, offering a more detailed visualization of public (Figure 11) and private (Figure 12) accessibility for each service type per urban block.

![Public Accessibility by Sector per Urban Block](output_vis/acc_public_aggr_z_map.png)

![Private Accessibility by Sector per Urban Block](output_vis/acc_private_aggr_z_map.png)

A comparison of the two set of maps reaffirms the broader reach of private transportation, with blue zones extending farther from the city center across all sectors. Yet even with car access, spatial inequality persists. The z-score standardization facilitates comparability across sectors, making it evident that accessibility is not uniformly distributed, regardless of transport mode. Together, these figures underscore a persistent spatial divide in Mexico City’s accessibility landscape. While private vehicles improve reach, they do not eliminate systemic disparities. Conversely, public transit accessibility remains highly centralized.

## REAL ESTATE MARKET

This section examines the structure of the real estate market in Mexico City through the lens of property listings, focusing on both price dynamics and spatial accessibility. By analyzing listing data disaggregated by housing typology, we explore how prices vary across the city in both absolute terms and per square meter. These patterns are then contextualized within an accessibility framework, assessing how well-connected each listing is.

### PRICE DISTRIBUTION

Figures 13 and 14 compare the distribution of property values derived from real estate listings in Mexico City, disaggregated by houses and flats to contextualize within prevailing market dynamics.

Figure 13 illustrates the distribution of absolute prices. Houses dominate the lower-to-mid price range, with a sharp peak between 100K and 300K USD, suggesting a concentration in more affordable areas. Flats, by contrast, exhibit a flatter and more extended distribution, with a notable presence in higher price brackets exceeding 500K USD.

![Dwelling Price Distribution by Type](output_vis/re_price_hist.png)

Figure 14 shifts focus to price per square meter, revealing a more nuanced distinction between dwelling types. Flats tend to cluster in the lower unit price ranges, with most listings concentrated between 1K and 2K USD per square meter, suggesting a higher frequency of smaller or more standardized units in relatively lower-cost locations. Houses, by contrast, display a broader distribution skewed toward higher price-per-square-meter values, peaking between 2K and 3K USD and extending further into the upper range.

![Dwelling Price per m2 Distribution per Type](output_vis/re_price_m2_hist.png)

Figure 15 shows the spatial distribution of real estate listings used in the sample, represented as point data across Mexico City (CDMX). The spatial pattern reveals a strong central clustering, with the highest concentration of listings located in and around the urban core, particularly in the central-western zones. While the density of listings decreases toward the urban periphery, the dataset achieves broad spatial coverage across most of Mexico City’s territory.

![Real Estate Listings](output_vis/re_sample_map.png)

### ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS

Figure 16 displays the relationship between real estate listing prices (per square meter) and public transport accessibility. Results show that 45.8% of listings fall into the low-access, low-price quadrant. A smaller share (18.3%) appears in the low-access, high-price quadrant. Listings with both high accessibility and high prices account for only 22.9%, while the high-access, low-price quadrant—a segment of particular interest for affordability and value—represents just 12.9% of the total.

![Real Estate Prices vs. Average Public Accessibility](output_vis/re_acc_pub_scat.png)

The spatial dynamics are further illustrated in Figure 17, which maps the quadrant classifications from the public accessibility analysis. The low-access, low-price listings dominate the urban periphery. The high-access, high-price properties cluster around the city core and well-connected central-western corridors. Only a few high-access, low-price listings are visible, while low-access, high-price listings are scattered across less connected but still expensive zones.

Figure 18 plots the same relationship using private accessibility. The share of listings in the high-access, high-price quadrant increases to 26.5%. Similarly, the high-access, low-price segment grows to 20.6%. Meanwhile, the low-access, low-price quadrant decreases to 38.2%, and the low-access, high-price quadrant drops to 14.8%. Overall, private accessibility appears to reduce the concentration of listings in the most disadvantaged category while expanding the potential for spatial opportunity in areas where public transport remains limited.

Figure 19, based on private accessibility, shows a notable spatial expansion of the high-access quadrants. High-access/high-price listings extend further beyond the core into more peripheral but car-connected areas, while affordable properties with high private accessibility are more broadly distributed across intermediate zones. The low-access/low-price area contracts, though it remains dominant in the far periphery, and the low-access/high-price is less prominent.

## HEDONIC PRICE MODEL RESULTS

This section presents the results of the hedonic pricing models examining the relationship between real estate listing prices and accessibility, estimated separately for public and private transport modes. Both models include accessibility to seven destination types—employment, education, gastronomy, health, public spaces, recreation, and retail—while controlling for structural dwelling attributes and neighborhood characteristics, including local crime rates, a social development index, and municipality-level fixed effects. The log-log specification allows coefficients to be interpreted as elasticities.

### PUBLIC ACCESSIBILITY

The results for the public-based model are presented in Figure 20. The model explains a high proportion of the variation in housing prices, with an adjusted R² of 0.837 across all specifications. The most robust and statistically significant predictor is employment accessibility, which has a positive elasticity of 0.242 (p \< 0.001, for the three scenarios), with a 95% confidence interval of \[0.127, 0.357\] under the most conservative scenario with clustered standard errors. This suggests that—caeteris paribus and on average— a 10% increase in cumulative job accessibility is associated with approximately a 2.4% increase in listing price.

Education accessibility is negatively associated with price, with a coefficient of –0.155. This effect is statistically significant under OLS (CI: \[–0.266, –0.044\]) and robust standard errors (CI: \[–0.281, –0.029\]), indicating that greater proximity to educational facilities is caeteris paribus, on average, related with lower listing prices. However, the effect loses statistical significance under clustered standard errors (CI: \[–0.383, 0.073\]).

Gastronomy accessibility has a positive effect on housing prices, with a coefficient of 0.169 that is statistically significant under both OLS and robust standard error specifications (p \< 0.05), and a 95% confidence interval of \[0.006, 0.331\] in the latter. However, when clustering standard errors at the municipal level, the confidence interval widens substantially to \[–0.113, 0.450\], encompassing zero and indicating that the effect may not be robust to spatial correlation.

A similar pattern is observed for health accessibility, which is positively associated with price in the OLS and robust models with a coefficient of 0.066 (p \< 0.05), and a 95% CI of \[0.005, 0.127\] under both. Yet, the effect becomes statistically insignificant when clustering is applied (CI: \[–0.055, 0.187\]), suggesting that these associations may not be robust to spatial correlation.

In contrast, public space and recreation accessibility show no significant relationship with listing prices under any model specification, with confidence intervals consistently centered around zero, indicating a lack of systematic association.

Notably, retail accessibility exhibits a consistently negative effect across all estimation strategies, with a coefficient of –0.274 and a 95% confidence interval under clustered standard errors of \[–0.441, –0.107\]. This suggests that—caeteris paribus and on average—a 10% increase in cumulative retail accessibility is associated with approximately a 2.7% decrease in listing price. This robust finding suggests that, contrary to conventional expectations, proximity to retail may be perceived as a disamenity.

Taken together, these results highlight the differentiated role of public accessibility dimensions in shaping housing prices. While employment accessibility emerges as the most robust and consistently positive determinant, other amenities such as education, health, and gastronomy exhibit more context-dependent effects that weaken once spatial clustering is accounted for. The lack of association for public space and recreation suggests these amenities may not be capitalized into housing prices in a systematic way, at least not through the mechanisms captured here. Conversely, the negative capitalization of retail accessibility—persistent across all model specifications—challenges common assumptions about commercial proximity as a universal benefit.

### PRIVATE ACCESSIBILITY

The results for the private-based model are presented in Figure 21. The model demonstrates strong explanatory power, with an adjusted R² of 0.839 across all specifications, indicating that the model accounts for a large proportion of the variation in listing prices. As in the public model, the most consistent and robust predictor is employment accessibility, which has a positive elasticity of 0.540 (p \< 0.001 under OLS and robust SEs; p \< 0.05 under clustered SEs). The 95% confidence interval under clustered standard errors is \[0.116, 0.963\], reinforcing the interpretation that—caeteris paribus and on average—a 10% increase in car-based employment accessibility is associated with a 5.4% increase in listing price. This effect is not only statistically significant but also substantively stronger than in the public accessibility model.

Education accessibility is negatively associated with price, with a coefficient of –0.209. The effect is statistically significant in the OLS model (p \< 0.05, CI: \[–0.402, –0.015\]) and marginally significant under robust standard errors (p \< 0.1, CI: \[–0.422, 0.004\]), but the effect weakens under clustered standard errors, where the 95% confidence interval expands to \[–0.675, 0.258\] and crosses zero.

For other amenities, gastronomy accessibility shows no statistically significant association with price under any specification. Its coefficient is positive but close to zero (0.044), and the clustered confidence interval (\[–0.421, 0.510\]) confirms the absence of a reliable relationship. Similarly, health accessibility has no effect on prices, with a coefficient of –0.006 and a clustered CI of \[–0.232, 0.220\].

Public spaces and recreation accessibility likewise do not show statistically significant effects. Public spaces have a positive coefficient of 0.055, but the clustered confidence interval (\[–0.067, 0.177\]) crosses zero. Recreation has a negative coefficient (–0.065) and similarly wide and inconclusive confidence intervals \[–0.440, 0.310\], indicating that neither amenity is systematically capitalized into listing prices when measured through private access.

As in the public accessibility model, retail accessibility exhibits a consistently strong and negative association with listing price. The coefficient is –0.326, statistically significant at p \< 0.001 across all specifications. The clustered confidence interval (\[–0.496, –0.157\]) remains narrow and well below zero, confirming the robustness of this finding. This suggests that—caeteris paribus and on average—a 10% increase in cumulative car-based retail accessibility is associated with a 3.3% decrease in listing price.

These results highlight the differentiated influence of private accessibility dimensions on housing prices in Mexico City. Employment accessibility by car stands out as the most robust and consistently positive predictor, suggesting that job reachability via private transport is highly valued and strongly capitalized into property values. In contrast, amenities such as education, health, gastronomy, public spaces, and recreation show limited or inconsistent effects, with their associations weakening or disappearing once spatial dependence is accounted for. As in the public model, the consistently negative relationship between retail accessibility and price challenges assumptions about the inherent desirability of commercial proximity, suggesting that higher retail density may, in some contexts, signal disamenities that detract from residential value.

# 5. DISCUSSION

The findings of this study offer important insights into how various forms of accessibility are capitalized into housing prices in Mexico City. Drawing from hedonic pricing models, the results highlight spatial disparities in access to employment and amenities, while also revealing the differentiated influence of accessibility across transportation modes and destination types. These patterns contribute to ongoing debates in the accessibility literature regarding how access is measured, perceived, and valued in real estate markets (Boisjoly & El-Geneidy, 2017; Levinson & Wu, 2020; Heyman et al., 2018).

The accessibility analysis confirms the persistence of a pronounced core–periphery divide in Mexico City, especially under public transport conditions. This pattern mirrors findings by Atuesta et al. (2018), who observed that employment accessibility in Mexico City remains highly concentrated in central areas and unequally distributed along socioeconomic lines. In particular, high-income households tend to benefit from proximity to job centers and mobility via private vehicles, while low-income populations are often relegated to peripheral zones with limited access to formal employment and public transport. The spatial clustering of high public accessibility in central and western districts underscores these structural disparities, reinforcing the barriers faced by transit-dependent populations in outlying areas. Although private vehicle access slightly reduces this divide by extending reach into intermediate zones, it does not overcome the underlying inequality in spatial opportunity.

Building on these foundational insights, the present study advances the analysis of spatial accessibility by disaggregating access by sector—an innovation that reveals important nuances in how different types of opportunities are distributed across the city. While previous studies have primarily focused on employment, this analysis incorporates a diverse range of destinations, including education, health, retail, gastronomy, recreation, and public spaces. This multidimensional approach uncovers uneven spatial patterns across sectors, suggesting that access to certain amenities remains highly centralized or limited depending on the mode of transport.

Methodologically, the study also addresses several limitations common in urban accessibility research. First, by using highly disaggregated spatial units—urban blocks as origins—it helps mitigate the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), which can distort results when coarser or arbitrary zones are used for modeling (Heyman et al., 2018). Second, accessibility is computed using both cumulative and gravity-based approaches, capturing different dimensions of spatial reach. The strong correlation between both measures suggests that simpler metrics may serve as practical proxies for more complex formulations under certain conditions. This supports the claim by Siddiq and Taylor (2021) that cumulative opportunities can be effective tools in planning practice, especially when resources for behavioral modeling are limited. However, the dispersion observed in the private mode underscores that sensitivity to measurement assumptions increases with impedance, suggesting that planners should exercise caution when interpreting accessibility under longer travel time assumptions or in uncongested car-centric models.

Moreover, when accessibility is viewed in relation to housing values, the results from the quadrant analysis show that low accessibility does not always equate to lower property prices. In fact, some high-value residential areas exhibit poor accessibility levels, suggesting that spatial isolation may be perceived as a desirable feature by higher-income households seeking privacy, exclusivity, or distance from urban intensity. These dynamics echo Wachs and Kumagai’s (1973) conception of physical accessibility as a social indicator—where access not only reflects urban structure but also reveals embedded patterns of exclusion shaped by income, infrastructure, and urban form.

When accessibility is linked to property values through hedonic modeling, the findings affirm Rosen’s (1974) theory that spatial attributes—such as reachability of destinations—are capitalized into housing prices as part of the location bundle. Employment accessibility emerges as the most robust predictor across both models, with elasticities ranging from 0.24 under public transit to 0.54 under car-based access. This reinforces the central role of job accessibility in shaping urban land values, consistent with evidence from developing contexts (Atuesta et al., 2018).

Compared to Atuesta et al.’s (2018) estimates—suggesting that a 1% reduction in distance to employment subcenters increases housing values by 1–3%—the elasticities reported here are notably smaller in relative terms. This difference partly reflects methodological divergences: whereas Atuesta et al. rely on distance to predefined employment subcenters as a proxy for accessibility, the present study adopts a cumulative opportunities approach, computed from census block-level origins to thousands of georreferenced destinations, providing a more spatially granular representation of access. Moreover, the regression framework employed here incorporates a broader set of control variables, including dwelling characteristics, local crime exposure, social development indicators, and municipal fixed effects—enhancing the robustness of the estimates by reducing potential omitted variable bias. Nevertheless, differences in data sources and time periods likely contribute as well. Atuesta’s analysis covers standardized housing projects from 2002 to 2013, whereas this study examines real estate listings from 2024, capturing a more heterogeneous housing market under contemporary spatial and institutional conditions. Taken together, these factors help explain why the magnitude of capitalization differs, while affirming the consistent directional importance of employment accessibility in urban housing markets.

The present study also challenges conventional assumptions about the uniform value of accessibility. Access to education, health, gastronomy, and public spaces shows limited or context-dependent effects, with many associations weakening once spatial clustering is accounted for. Perhaps most striking is the consistent negative association between retail accessibility and housing prices—across both transport modes and all specifications. This challenges widely held assumptions about linear relationships between accessibility and house prices, potentially exhibiting thresholds where its effect saturates or diminishes (e.g., Liu et al., 2024) suggesting that retail density may also signal congestion, noise, or informal activity, especially in large cities.

It is important to acknowledge, however, that the accessibility indicators used in this study are based on broad 2-digit classifications of economic units following the NAICS system, without further disaggregation by quality, specialization, or service intensity. As a result, these categories may encompass a wide variety of establishments with differing levels of desirability, functionality, or user perception. This aggregation could obscure localized effects, especially in cases where accessibility to higher-quality or better-managed facilities might positively influence property values, while proximity to lower-quality or oversaturated services might do the opposite. In addition, the current structure does not account for the size or capacity of each economic unit. All establishments are weighted equally, regardless of their employment level. While alternative approaches—such as measuring accessibility by total jobs per sector—could provide more nuanced estimates of economic scale and influence, they also introduce new complications. Specifically, job counts may reflect administrative or support roles unrelated to the primary function of the establishment, or incorporate sectoral distortions due to firm size and internal hierarchies, thereby complicating the behavioral interpretation of access. These limitations align with Heyman et al.’s (2018) critique that proximity alone cannot fully capture the experiential or qualitative dimensions of accessibility, particularly in dense urban contexts where perceptions of congestion, noise, or informal activity may mediate the value of nearby amenities.

An additional methodological consideration concerns the presence of multicollinearity among the accessibility indicators. Because many destination types tend to co-locate in urban space, their respective accessibility measures are often highly correlated. While multicollinearity does not bias coefficient estimates, it can inflate standard errors and thereby reduce the statistical significance of individual predictors, potentially obscuring meaningful relationships. This is particularly relevant when interpreting the weaker or inconsistent effects observed for certain amenities. In this study, all accessibility indicators were deliberately retained to preserve the sectoral focus and interpretive clarity of the model, rather than apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. To mitigate the inferential uncertainty that may result from multicollinearity—as well as spatial autocorrelation—clustered standard errors at the municipal level were employed. This specification produces more conservative estimates, allowing for correlated error structures within local submarkets while maintaining the integrity of the model’s structural assumptions.

Moreover, while the model controls for a range of structural and neighborhood-level factors and incorporates fixed effects and clustered standard errors at the municipal level, it is important to recognize that the analysis is designed to capture broader, citywide patterns rather than localized dynamics. As such, the model is more reflective of average relationships across the urban region than of specific neighborhoods or submarkets. These local dynamics, shaped by complex socio-spatial histories, land use patterns, and community preferences, may exert significant influence on housing prices but remain unobserved in this framework. While neighborhood-level controls such as crime incidence and social development index help account for some of this variation, the absence of finer-scale fixed effects and the sample distribution reflects a necessary tradeoff driven by data and sample size constraints. As such, the findings should be interpreted as identifying average structural relationships across Mexico City, rather than providing full explanatory coverage of localized valuation processes.

These results highlight a tension between accessibility as a normative planning goal and accessibility as a market-valued trait. While policy frameworks often prioritize increasing access to services and jobs for equity and efficiency reasons (El-Geneidy & Levinson, 2022), the housing market may assign variable and sometimes negative value to these same features, depending on how they intersect with perceptions of quality, safety, and environmental context. This underscores the importance of integrating behavioral realism and local contextual sensitivity into accessibility modeling—especially when applying these insights to housing policy, transit-oriented development, or land value capture mechanisms.

# 6. CONCLUSION

This thesis examined how sector-specific accessibility is capitalized into housing prices in Mexico City, offering new insights into the city’s spatial and economic dynamics. By integrating real estate data with granular, disaggregated, and multimodal accessibility indices, the analysis found that employment accessibility is the strongest and most consistently valued form—particularly under private transport scenarios. In contrast, access to education, health services, and public spaces showed weaker or inconsistent associations, while retail accessibility consistently emerged as a potential disamenity across all model specifications.

These findings challenge the conventional assumption that accessibility uniformly enhances real estate value. Instead, they point to a more complex, context-dependent relationship likely shaped by quality differentiation, neighborhood perceptions, and the nature of specific sectors. While accessibility remains central to urban policy goals aimed at improving equity and mobility, the housing market may assign negative or neutral value to certain forms of proximity—especially when they conflict with preferences for exclusivity, privacy, or distance from urban intensity.

Methodologically, this study advances the literature through the use of granular origins and disaggregated destinations, and by employing both cumulative and gravity-based accessibility measures. Although the regression framework included detailed neighborhood controls, the analysis encountered substantial multicollinearity among some accessibility indicators due to the spatial correlation of many urban amenities. While all variables were retained to preserve sectoral interpretability, this multicollinearity likely inflated standard errors and may have obscured overlapping effects. To mitigate these issues, clustered standard errors were applied to account for correlation structures within municipalities.

Future research could build on this foundation by incorporating measures of amenity quality, refining sectoral classifications, and evaluating accessibility based on job counts or service capacity rather than simple establishment presence. In addition, accounting for traffic congestion would enhance the interpretability and policy relevance of private accessibility estimates. Finally, as noted in the literature, the integration of big data and machine learning offers promising avenues—so long as transparency and interpretability remain central to their use in planning and policy contexts.

Ultimately, this study highlights the value of disaggregated and context-sensitive approaches to understanding how different forms of accessibility shape housing markets. By revealing the uneven ways in which access is valued across sectors, modes, and urban geographies, the findings call attention to the complex interplay between spatial structure, market dynamics, and social equity. These insights offer a foundation for designing more targeted, evidence-based urban policies—particularly in Global South cities like Mexico City, where long-standing inequalities demand planning frameworks that reflect both behavioral realities and spatial diversity.
